            And smart companies know that ‚Äúgood‚Äù is good enough.

            Hiring companies: don‚Äôt waste time searching for the perfect candidate.
            
            What doesn‚Äôt glitter can still be GOLD!
            
            Preparing first job interviews are always stressfu and It is natural to get little dose of butterflies in your stomach.
            but theres always a space for safe lane to follow on road which can prove to be the right things to do.
            So, Here are my list of 5 thing that are to be avoided to ace in your next interview.
            
            <br>
            <br>

         
            1.Where money is involved discipline is key<br>
                
                Avoid being late for the interview. It basically ruins your impression in front of the people and it is highly recommended to be infact reach 
                at minimum 30.min preior to that given time of the interview.
            <br>
            <br>2.Clear resume<br>
            
                The first thing that reaches the other side of the table is your resume and It is your only chance to express particularly your first impression. 
                It is highly recommended to get your Resume perfectly tailored according to the Job Description.<br>
            
            <br>3.Perfect Introduction<br>
            
                In interview cabin it might be the case that you are the only person who is "speaking". And the interviewer is only throwing questions at you.
                So take this as an opportuninty and cover anythung and everything about you and put it on the desk as quickly as possible. The more you speak the less question you encounter.
            <br>
            <br>4.Smart companies know that ‚Äúgood‚Äù is good enough.<br>
            
                If you are invited for the the Interview that clearly means you fit the job requirements and thus it should be avoided to act desperate in an interview. 
                companies will hire good attitude over good skill. be desperate to learn not desperate to earn.
            
            <br><br>5.Don't Nargain too much.<br>
            
                This is the area where all freshers and even experienced people are rejected after being infact the perfect candidate for the job.
                Small companies and even more startups run on a very tight budget and so its difficult to be expecting to increase the margin of 20%-30% of the current offer.
